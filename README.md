  1.The experimental equipment consisted of two AMTI force plates (BP400600-OP-1000, The United States), a set of Optima signal amplifiers, two wireless inertial sensors (MTw, Xsens Technologies BV, Enschede, The Netherlands), and a Awinda Station receiver. All algorithms were performed in a personal computer with Microsoft Windows 10, an Intel Core Processor i7-13700K, 32 GB RAM and GPU of NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090.
  IMU data processing and force plate data alignment processing is implemented in matlab.Traditional machine learning and deep learning algorithms are implemented in pycharm（Python=3.7、cuda=11.7、keras=2.10、numpy=1.21.5、scikit-learn=1.0.2）.
  2.We defined the sit-to-stand transition into five phases including the initial sitting phase, the flexion momentum phase, the momentum transfer phase, the extension phase, and the stable standing phase based on two IMUs. We then proposed an threshold method and CNN-BiLSTM-Attention algorithm to accurately identify these phases.
  3.The study compared traditional machine learning algorithms such as SVM, NB, 1NN, DT, LR, RF, and deep learning algorithms including CNN, LSTM, CNN-Bi-LSTM, Bi-LSTM, and Gated-Transformer.
